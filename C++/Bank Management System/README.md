# Project - OOP - Bank Management System
# Key Concepts:
This project focuses on implementing core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Virtualization, and the Diamond Inheritance Problem. The system will simulate a bank management system, incorporating functionalities such as account management, transactions, and user operations.

# Project Requirements:
The application must include at least five classes, each representing different entities of the banking system. The structure should be carefully designed to maintain data encapsulation and logical relationships between the classes.

# Each class must implement the following:

- A default constructor (without parameters) for creating objects with default values.
- A parameterized constructor to initialize objects with specific attributes.
- A copy constructor to allow object duplication.
- Overloaded assignment operator (=) to properly copy values from one object to another.
- A destructor to handle object cleanup when no longer needed.
- Overloaded input (>>) and output (<<) operators for easy data manipulation.
- At least one functionality that reflects a real banking operation, such as depositing money, withdrawing funds, or checking account balances.


# OOP Concepts to be Demonstrated: 
-> Encapsulation:
- Each class should follow the encapsulation principle, keeping data members private and providing access through getters and setters.

-> Inheritance:
- At least three classes must demonstrate inheritance, ensuring that shared functionalities are properly extended.
- The project must include multiple levels of inheritance, where a derived class inherits from another derived class.
  
-> Polymorphism:
- The project should illustrate both function overloading and function overriding, showing how different behaviors can be implemented for similar operations.

-> Virtualization:
- At least one class must use virtual functions to allow dynamic method overriding and ensure proper object-oriented behavior.

-> Abstract Classes & Interfaces:
- The project must include at least one abstract class or interface, defining a blueprint for related classes.
- This abstract class should contain at least one pure virtual function, enforcing its implementation in derived classes.
  
-> Multiple Inheritance & Diamond Problem:
- The project must include multiple inheritance, with an example of the diamond inheritance problem and how to resolve it using virtual base classes.

Interactive Menu & Core Functionalities (The system should include an interactive menu, allowing users to perform fundamental operations such as):
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for bank accounts and transactions.
- Processing deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers between accounts.
- Displaying transaction history and balance inquiries.

# For the interactive menu:
- Overloaded operators should be used to handle user input and navigation.
- At least one constant method should be implemented to ensure immutable operations (e.g., checking account balance without modification).
