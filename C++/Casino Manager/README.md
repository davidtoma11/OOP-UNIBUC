# Project - OOP - Casino Management System

# Project Requirements:
The goal of this project is to create a mini application that manages a business/agenda/planning system, simulating the functionality of a casino. The application should be designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and must include the management of multiple entities involved in the casino environment, such as games, users, and transactions.

# Main Specifications:
The project must consist of at least 4 classes, all of which should be interconnected, demonstrating the relationships between different entities. Each class should contain at least 4 variables that represent different data types, as described in the project specifications. Additional variables can be added if necessary for proper functionality.

For at least two of these classes, Setters and Getters must be implemented. Additionally, the project must ensure that Setters and Getters are present for all the variables mentioned in the specifications.

# Each class must have the following:

- A constructor with all parameters to initialize the class with specific values.
- At least two parameterized constructors to provide flexibility when creating objects with different initialization scenarios.
- A default constructor (without parameters) for easy creation of objects when no specific values are required at first.
- A copy constructor to create a new object as a copy of an existing one, allowing for object duplication.
- A destructor to handle proper memory management and cleanup when an object is no longer needed.
- Overloading the assignment operator (=) to properly assign one object to another.
- Overloading input and output operators (<< and >>) to facilitate input/output of the class objects in a user-friendly way.

Additionally, you must overload the following operators for each class:
- Indexing operator [ ] for accessing elements or properties within the class (similar to array access).
- Increment (++) or decrement (--) operators to modify certain properties of the class objects.
- *At least two mathematical operators (+, -, , or /) to support operations between objects of the class.
- An explicit or implicit cast operator to enable the conversion of an object to another type.
- A conditional operator (<, >, <=, >=) to compare objects based on certain criteria.
- Equality operator (==) to check whether two objects are equivalent.
- Each class should be designed to handle real-world functionalities, simulating actual processes in a casino, such as game management, user management, or transaction tracking.

# Interactive Menu and Core Functionalities:
The project must include an interactive menu that allows users to perform basic operations, such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD operations). The menu should be designed to demonstrate the applicationâ€™s key functionalities in a clear and user-friendly manner, allowing users to easily navigate through different sections of the casino management system.

# Specific Functionalities:
In addition to the standard requirements, this project must also implement specific functionalities relevant to the casino theme, such as:
- Slot games, which allow users to interact with a game interface where they can spin and win based on certain odds.
- Roulette, where users can place bets and spin the wheel, simulating the experience of a traditional casino game.
  
These functionalities should be seamlessly integrated into the overall system, making it more dynamic and representative of a real casino environment.
